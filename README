Data Structure Course Final Project

This page is for Data Structure Course Final Project.

And the project's name is Tetris.

As the author of this page, I would post all code I get for this project.

If you have any question, please connect me via my email.

So, have fun.

---update on Feb, 20, 2012 "fifth commit"---
ds_project_manual.pdf is a technical report which describes and records Tetris we create.
Now it is just a format without any contents. We may discuss it later.

---update on Feb. 20, 2012 "sixth commit"---
012BlockDown.java is a program which shows how to make the block go down automatically.
This file provides a clear view of simple GUI program design.

---update on Feb. 22, 2012 "seventh commit"---
013FillBlock.java is a program which can fill all frame with block automatically.
Furthermore, the program can cancel the line which has filled.

---update on Mar. 30, 2012 "generic class tutorial 2"---
In this update, I upload some simple data structure which represent by generic class.
You may want to check it.

---update on Mar. 31, 2012 "sorting algorithms"---
I upload five basic sorting algorithms.
You can check it if you have any problem on implementing these algorithms.

Thanks Johny Sulliven pointed out the mistake I made.

Important Message:

The reason why I wrote these code is to help the students who have implement
problem on data structure.

So, if you have any problem, I hope you can email or message me.

By the way, recently, I would upload a series of foundational algorithms,
so please check it if you need.
