ds_project_manual.pdf is a technical report which describes and records Tetris we create.
Now it is just a format without any contents. We may discuss it later.

---update on Feb. 20, 2012 "sixth commit"---
012BlockDown.java is a program which shows how to make the block go down automatically.
This file provides a clear view of simple GUI program design.
